<!-- Author:  Brandon Nishimura-->
<!--Description: This is the schedule page that allows users who have an account with us to see when their next lesson in.
    User must be logged in before viewing the schedue page 

    IMPORTANT NOTES: Current page is hard-coded for the student 'Thursday' (excepting the username personalization). You can not test new
    students since new students will be *assigned* a day for lessons. That must be hard-coded in by an administrator as per our system.

    However, system would not be challenging to expand to other students. This is just a note to alert you that this system is not automatic
    and requires administrative input to function. 

    This also applies to the modification function, which is a REQUEST rather than an automated system.

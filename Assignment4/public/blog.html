            1. Take a Break
        </h3>
        You never want practicing to become a chore, though it can start to feel that way sometimes. Learning an
        instrument takes persistence and dedication, and practice can become frustrating when things don’t come as
        easily as you’d like. If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed, do something else for a few hours, or even the
        day. Taking a break will help relieve your stress and frustration, and make you more refreshed and confident for
        the next practice session.
        <br>
        <h3>
            2. Play Music You Enjoy
        </h3>

        The key to improving is regular practice. But if you’re feeling unmotivated because you don’t love the music
        you’re playing, it’s unlikely that you’ll stick with it. By adding a few of your favorite tunes to your routine,
        you’ll be more excited to practice the piano. Even if these tunes don’t challenge your skills that much, it’s
        always beneficial to get your fingers on the keys, so make it more fun for yourself!

        <h3>
            3. Learn Your Theory
        </h3>

        Though it can seem boring at first, learning the fundamentals of music theory will make playing the piano a lot
        more fun as you progress. This foundational knowledge will allow you to play more freely as your skills improve,
        and give you the ability to play a wider, more varied repertoire. Learn the basics of theory, including key
        signatures, note values, chords, rests, the grand staff, etc. Test yourself regularly—make sure you can identify
        the difference between a quarter note and an eighth note, a G and a D on the grand staff and piano, and a major
        chord and a minor chord

        <h3>
            4. Work on Scales
        </h3>
        Scales help engrain your knowledge of the 12 key signatures. When you play scales as part of your regular
        routine, you’ll learn which notes are sharp or flat within each key, and your hands will become more familiar
        with the piano at the same time. Take your time, and don’t worry too much about learning all the scales and
        playing them perfectly right away. To build your accuracy, it’s a good idea to start slowly and gradually
        increase your speed, as we talk about in the next tip.
        <br>
        <h3>
            5. Take It Slow
        </h3>
        It’s important to start out at a slow tempo when learning scales and new pieces of music. Firstly, you want to
        learn the music the right way, with the correct notes and rhythms. If you rush through the music, skipping notes
        and missing rhythms, it’ll be harder to come back later and fix your engrained mistakes. Secondly, you want to
        acquire the muscle memory and technique required to play the piece well. If you learn something in a sloppy,
        rushed manner, you won’t gain the technical ability to play it properly, and you’ll probably develop bad habits
        that will be difficult to overcome later.

            We believe every child comes to our world with musical ability. At My Piano Studio, we strive to foster
            and inspire this natural capacity. We strive to bring out the innate musicality in each and every student.
            Music is a necessary part of life and children need the beauty and expression of music just as much as they
            need to know how to read and multiply.

            <br>
            <br>

            We recognize that every student has unique needs and abilities; therefore we adjust our teaching approach to
            address those needs and maximize their potential. We believe that all children are capable of learning music
            and that teaching includes a never-ending journey of discovery to find out what enables them to be
            successful learners.

                Dave Yoshida, founder of My Piano Studio, was born and raised in Honolulu, HI. Ever since the age of 4,
                Dave
                took piano lessons from his father, Todd Yoshida. It was always Dave's dream to open his own piano
                studio so
                that he could share his love for piano with everyone in Hawaii. In 2001, Dave had the opportunity to
                purchase a piece of land in Aiea. In 2017, Dave was able to secure a spot in SALT Kakaako.
